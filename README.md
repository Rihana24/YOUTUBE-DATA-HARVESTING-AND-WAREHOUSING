# YOUTUBE-DATA-HARVESTING-AND-WAREHOUSING
This project is about YouTube data harvesting and warehousing using MongoDB, SQL and StreamLit Application

PROJECT TITLE : YOUTUBE DATA HARVESTING AND WAREHOUSING 

INTRODUCTION:

Youtube-Data-Harvesting-And-Warehousing is a project that intends to provide users with the ability to access and analyse data from numerous YouTube channels. SQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit are used in the project to develop a user-friendly application that allows users to retrieve, save, and query YouTube channel and video data.

Project Overview: 

The YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing project consists of the following components:

1. Streamlit Application: A user-friendly UI built using Streamlit library, allowing users to interact with the application and perform data retrieval and analysis tasks.

2. YouTube API Integration: Integration with the YouTube API to fetch channel and video data based on the provided channel ID.

3. MongoDB: Storage of the retrieved data in a MongoDB database, providing a flexible and scalable solution for storing unstructured and semi-structured data.

4. Postgre SQL: PostgreSQL is an open-source, advanced, and highly scalable database management system (DBMS) that provides a platform for storing and managing structured data. Here the data from MongoDB is migrated to postgre sql for efficient querying and analysis using SQL queries.

STEPS FOR EXECUTION: 

Once the project is setup and running, users can access the Streamlit application through a web browser. The application will provide a user interface where users can perform the following actions:

1. Enter a YouTube channel ID to store the channel details.

2. Using the Youtube API we can retrieve the channel and video data from YouTube.

3. Store the retrieved data in the MongoDB as a data lake.

4. Collect and store data for multiple YouTube channels in the data lake.

5. Migration of data from the data lake to a SQL database for efficient querying and analysis.
